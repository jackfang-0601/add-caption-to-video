This program allowed you to use OpenAi whispter to generate subtitle and put the subtitle on the viedo. Whispter can generate an srt file, and use moviepy to put the srt file on to the orginal viedo.

# changes you need to make
```
api_key = "your api key"
mp4filename = "/content/drive/My Drive/python_file/input_video.mp4"
#change to your file name
srtfilename = "/content/drive/My Drive/python_file/subtitles1.srt"
#change to your file name
```
I did my program on colab, you can just put the file path if you are using your computer local compiler.
